Machine Learning project predicting student performance in History and Geography using real-world data
# 🎓 Predicting Student Performance in History and Geography

🎉 This is my first collaborative machine learning project, developed with @Ifeoluwa (Ruth) Olonijolu [https://github.com/IfeoluwaRuth/IfeoluwaRuth.github.io], a Graduate Student at Université de Montréal.

We analyzed academic data from Algerian high schools to predict pass/fail outcomes and uncover actionable insights in student performance.

## 🔍 Project Summary

*Title*: Predicting Student Performance in History and Geography
*Dataset*: [Kaggle - Students Annual Score](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fundal/students-annual-score-in-history-geography-subject)

*Goal*: To analyze academic performance and predict student success based on term assessments using machine learning models.

## 📊 Key Insights

* Female students consistently outperformed male students across all assessment types.
* Student performance dipped in the second semester and recovered in the third.
* The most important predictors of final scores were:

  * First exam
  * Second exam
  * Third test
